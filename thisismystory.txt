Oak       : Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is OAK!
            People call me the POKEMON PROF!

* - An image of a Nidorino appears.

Oak       : This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some
            people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...
            I study POKEMON as a profession.

* - An image of a boy (the player's character) appears.

Oak       : First, what is your name?

* - The first option is that of the version which one is playing.

Oak       : Right! So your name is RED!

* - An image of another boy appears.

Oak       : This is my grandson. He's been your rival since you were a baby.

            ...Erm, what is his name again?

* - The first option is that of the version which one is not playing.

Oak       : That's right! I remember now! His name is BLUE!

* - Red's image reappears.

Oak       : RED! Your very own POKEMON legend is about to unfold! A world of
            dreams and adventures with POKEMON awaits! Let's go!
